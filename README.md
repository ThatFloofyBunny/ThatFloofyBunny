# About me
My name is Floofy! Feel free to refer to me as Bunny too- if you'd like!

I'm interested in learning computer science skills and cybersecurity practices as well as software development and maintenance!

There's many different hobbies and activties I want to delve into to see if something's the right fit for me!

If you want my insight on anything, god forbid, then you can reach out to me!
